      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p> Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, 
and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine
regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.<BR>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.<BR>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself.  - list all sources you used.https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/</p>
